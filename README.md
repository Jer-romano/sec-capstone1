# Capstone
## Website Name: Optimal

### About
The goal of my website is to help patients taking antidepressants find the best drug for them. It will incorporate some of the features of a "mood tracker"
app, but will also have some unique features. It can be difficult to rate the effectiveness of an antidepressant, because there are so many outside factors
that can affect our mood. This
website will attempt to quantify the effectiveness of a drug. That way, a patient can see to what degree the drug is working, and will have better,
more quantitative feedback to give their doctor than “I think it’s helping”, or, “It’s not helping”.

### API
#### Update
The API that I am using is a motivational quote API called Quotel. I decided to use this API for the time being because the medicine API can only retrieve very large blocks of text that are too verbose for my application. I'm planning on instead building my own database with the top 100 or so medications and then linking this to my application.  
----------

The API that I will be using is called DrugAPI.  https://rapidapi.com/ddowar-1g0Q3PyrJyP/api/drugapi
It isn't maintained by a company, but rather an individual. Most of the Drug-Related APIs I found were either 1) Not free (i.e. myHealthBox), or 2) The information they had was too verbose for my application, and it would've been a pain to try to parse out the relevant information.
