# Capstone
## Website Name: TBD

### About
The goal of my website is to help patients taking antidepressants find the best drug for them. It will incorporate some of the features of a "mood tracker"
app, but will also have some unique features. It can be difficult to rate the effectiveness of an antidepressant, because there are so many outside factors
that can affect our mood. This
website will attempt to quantify the effectiveness of a drug. That way, a patient can see to what degree the drug is working, and will have better,
more quantitative feedback to give their doctor than “I think it’s helping”, or, “It’s not helping”.

### API
The API I will be using is called DrugAPI.
