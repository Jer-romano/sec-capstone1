    <h1>About</h1>
<h4>
    The goal of my website is to help patients taking antidepressants find the best drug for them.
     It will incorporate some of the features of a "mood tracker" app, but will also have some unique
      features. It can be difficult to rate the effectiveness of an antidepressant, because there are 
      so many outside factors that can affect our mood. This website will attempt to quantify the
       effectiveness of a drug. That way, a patient can see to what degree the drug is working, and will
        have better, more quantitative feedback to give their doctor than “I think it’s helping”, or, “It’s
        not helping”.
